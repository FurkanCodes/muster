//! The messages between the daemon and its clients (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6).
//!
//! Versioning rules (`ARC-09`):
//! - every change to these types bumps [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`];
//! - a new optional field carries `#[serde(default)]`;
//! - a new variant is sent only to a peer whose agreed version knows it;
//! - removing or renaming anything also raises [`MIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION`].
//!
//! Frames are encoded with named fields, so a field can be added to any
//! message, including [`Hello`], without breaking older peers.
